                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Jayson Patrick V. Arieta. I was born on October 28, 2005,<br>
                    and I’m now 19 years old. I live in Navotas City, which is part of Manila.<br>
                    We are five in the family — I have one older brother and one younger sister. I’m the middle child.
                    I’m a quiet person, especially when I don’t know the people around me, but once I get comfortable, I’m friendly and easy to talk to.
                </p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I’m currently studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), and I’m now in my second year at Datamex College of Saint Adeline.
                Back in senior high school, I studied at Arellano University – Elisa Esguerra Campus. I was always part of the honor list there.
                I try my best in school because I believe education is a big part of reaching my goals.
            </p>

        <section id="hobbies" class="hobbies-section">
            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>
                In my free time, I love playing online games. My favorite games are Mobile Legends and Honor of Kings.
                Playing helps me relax and enjoy time with my friends. I also enjoy just having quiet moments, especially after a long day.
            </p>

            <h2>Dreams and Goals</h2>
            <p>
                When I was younger, I really wanted to become a pilot. But life led me to the IT course I’m taking now.
                Even though I have a different path, I still have big dreams. One of my goals is to give my parents a better life
                because they’ve done so much for me. I also dream of having my own happy family in the future —
                and I want to be a good husband and a great dad someday.
            </p>
